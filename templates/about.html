    <td>I am a 4th year student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science. I was born in Miami and I lived there until I was about 10. Then I moved to Brownsville, TX and went to middle school and high school there. After graduated high school in 2012, I applied to the University of Texas at Austin. I've been living in Austin ever since. I love playing music and I'm a member of the UT Pep Band as well as the UT Steel Pan Ensemble. I love biking all over Austin. You can usually find me biking around town on the weekends with my fiance, Barbara. I also love to code, and I made my career out of it.</td>
